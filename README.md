# Eye Follow You
*Use "Life Server" to make the Eye work.* <br><br>

### The Assignment
I made this assignment for a school class called: "Medialab". Medialab was a class where 5 multidisciplinair students would need to co-operate to form a team. Three of the students where from my own Study (Creative Media & Game technology) and two were from Communication Multimedia Design. 

We were assigned to make an Interactive Application for "Bevrijdingsdag 2020". Our goal was to teach people about Social Cooling and show them in what ways their privacy was in danger.

After lots of research we found out that most people forget to turn off their Bluetooth. By connecting to the Bluetooth of unsuspecting people we found out that we can know where they are as long as they are close proximity. We also found out that by connecting to their Bluetooth we could find out what their name is, since a lot of people have named their own phones after themselves by default. 

Our idea was a program which would create a new Eye on a Smart Board every time it connects with someone's Bluetooth. This Eye would then try to follow the invidual around. When the individual walked away from the Smart Board, the Eye/Smart Board would yell out the indivuals name, asking him/her to come back. By doing this we wanted to show people how much information they give away about themselves without even noticing.

### Result
Sadly, because of Corona we couldn't go ahead with this. Instead we moved the project to the Internet (which would make it more accessible) and replaced the Bluetooth part of the idea with the mouse of the user. In this repository you can a part of our project and see how I made the Eye follow the mouse around.
